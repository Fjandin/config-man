# Contributing

This document describes some processes and guidelines we follow as a team and will help make the contribution process as smooth as possible! ‚ú®

---

## a) Follow the [PR and Code Review Culture at Pleo](https://www.notion.so/pleo/PR-and-Code-Review-Culture-at-Pleo-220324344eb849f3b636cd00a28b4a41) guidelines

## b) Add appropriate reviewers

When creating your PR, please add the following reviewers:

- `@pleo-io/localisation` or individual members of your team

Keep the number of reviewers small to make it obvious who is responsible for reviewing the PR.

## c) Once approved, you are responsible for merging your PR

Unless otherwise arranged, we will never merge your PRs. It's your code and you know best when it's ready to be merged.

## d) We strive to at least respond to review requests within 24 hours

_Obviously this does not apply on weekends and days we are out of office._

GitHub will avoid auto-assigning organisation members that are set to Busy, so watch out for the status indicator when assigning reviewers. üèñ

In general, we will review and approve/leave feedback on your PR within 24 hours, but in some cases we may not be able to dedicate the time necessary to give it a thorough review. Feel free to ping us if you see PRs go stale.

## e) One change per PR

Keeping PRs focused on a single change makes them easier (and faster) to review. We may ask you to split up a large PR if it includes many unrelated changes.

## f) Fill out the PR description

The more context you can provide in the PR description, the better equipped we will be to review it.
This will make reviews more effective and faster. üöÄ

You can also add inline comments on your own PR to add some context or point our areas you want your reviewers to focus on.
